# RME-DDPM: Conditional Diffusion Models for Radio Map Estimation

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of **RME-DDPM** (Radio Map Estimation using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models), a novel approach for accurately estimating radio signal distributions in complex environments. The method leverages the strengths of diffusion models combined with conditional inputs, such as building maps and transmitter locations, to improve the accuracy and adaptability of radio map estimation.
